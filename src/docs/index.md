## Description of the project

The Plastic Origins package developed by Surfrider Foundation Europe is a participatory science project aimed at mapping plastic pollution in rivers in France and Europe. The project uses an artificial intelligence algorithm to
detect and count the wastes washed up on river banks. This mapping will make it possible to identify the territories most affected, to propose solutions to local actors and to measure the evolutiono of pollutionover time.
